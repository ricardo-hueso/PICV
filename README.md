# PICV
PICV stands for Particle  Image Correlation Velocimetry (software written in IDL)


* December 01 2020 *

This project is the 3rd version of the Particle Image Correlation Velocimetry Software (PICV)

PICV was created by Dr. Ricardo Hueso at UPV/EHU as a software tool to retrieve wind fields 
in images of planetary objects with atmospheres by analyzing the displacement of common regions
found in images separated by a given amount of time.

Questions about the use of the software can be issued to ricardo.hueso@ehu.eus
If you use the software and find it useful please drop a line to the author.

The software is written in IDL and should be able to run in IDL6.0 or higher.

The software is distributed under creative commons license 4.0 

The original version of the software is described in:
* Hueso et al. Icarus (2019), doi:10.1016/j.icarus.2009.05.004 

Different versions of the software have been used in several publications including:

* Garcia-Melendo et al. Icarus 2011, doi: 10.1016/j.icarus.2010.11.020

The software has been shared openly in the past with other research teams including
Pedro Machado's team at the Observatory of Lisbon and is available here for other users
